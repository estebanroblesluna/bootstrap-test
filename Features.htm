							<h5> Model based development
							The development in Abztractionz is based on an Application model: a composition of Flows and a Flow describes a sequence of steps that needs to happen within a Web request (called Message in our approach). A Message has a payload (body) and a list of properties while each step is visually identified by an icon and constitutes an Element of the flow. Communication between Elements happens by the interchange of messages and the way messages are moved from one Element to another one is defined by the Connections between them</h5>

							<h3 class="media-heading">Performance monitoring</h3>
							<h5> In Abztractionz we allow Element profiling, meaning we allow the temporary measuring of the performance of the Element. It helps with the identification of elements that are consuming more time to complete in the Flow and as a consequence helps to model optimization. We can attach multiple profilers to our elements and see how the average response time changes as traffic comes in.

							<h3 class="media-heading">Dynamic and conditional logging</h3>
							<h5> Logging is a practical tool for discovering the state of a message and fix production problems. As well as profilers, we allow attaching loggers dynamically without a redeployment process. In Abztractionz, we also allow condition logging, that’s it, log information if it only satisfies some conditions. This is extremely important as it helps to reduce the performance degradation of the elements when thousands of messages are processed per second and because it filters messages that we know are not causing the problem. Nevertheless, all messages can be logged with a “true” condition.

							<h3 class="media-heading">Runtime transformations</h3>
							<h5> Some production problems can be easily fixed in Abztractionz. For example, an Element is running slow and we start to see a degradation of the service. After some investigation with our tools, we conclude that some operations are taking longer than expected due to more information on the system. In this scenario, Abztractionz allows you to apply a runtime transformation over your models to see if the performance improves. A variety of this "patterns" have been categorized for you and can be safely applied @ runtime to your models.
